completely developed in ReactJs.

I am a final year undergraduate student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Government Engineering College, Bilaspur, India. I am native of Korba, Chhattisgarh.

I have been the vice president of the CSE department in session 2018-19 and lead the team to organize various events. I was selected for the Tuition Fee Waiver scholarship and got a 100% scholarship in my college tuition fees.

I believe that the best way to learn something is by sharing what you learned, so, with my friends I have ignited a developer club in my college to make a local programming community and to help each other by sharing knowledge. We have 150+ members currently enrolled in from different branches who are full of enthusiasm and always ready to take challenges.

I like making new connections and learning new things by sharing knowledge.

For any new project ping me, I always like to work on new ideas.
